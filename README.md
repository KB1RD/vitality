# Vitality

This is a work-in-progress fork of Vitalium, which is a fork of Matt Tytel's Vital synth.

The Vitalium fork improves the build system and fixes some bugs, especially on Linux systems, and removes external server connections.

The goal of Vitality is to add additional features to the Vital synth codebase, and Vitalium is used as a base for modifications.

This readme is a work in progress.
